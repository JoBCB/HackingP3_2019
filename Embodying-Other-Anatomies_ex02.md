__1) Choose one organ; define its characteristics and functionalities.__

	Where in the body is it located? 
	How is it connected? 
	What does it do?

> For example:
> Location: In humans the stomach is located between the oesophagus and the small intestine. More a less centrally located in the body …
> Main function: Digestion. The stomach serves as a temporary receptacle for storage and mechanical distribution of food before it is passed into the intestine …

__2) Choose an electronic device, component, or other technology to replace it. Explain why.__

	How does it affect its location?
	How does the new replacement change the original performance?
	How does it relate with neighbouring organs?
	Is it just a new technology or an ecosystem of its own?

	How would this new technology affect the overall performance of the body?


__3) In your group answer and discuss the issues around this questions:__

	Who owns the embedded technology?
	What issues would the new body foresee in terms of privacy and security?
	How much access would an individual have to modify the technology?
	How is the technology updated? 
	Is it possible to repair or to replace? How?
	How long will the technology last? Will it continue living in the after-life of the body?


	If we were in a society where everyone would have that same body, how would this change society as a whole? 
	How differently would people interact?
	Would this change affect or create a new economy?

	Are there any immediate consequences when thinking about the role as citizen? 
	Does the technology influence the democratic performance or increases risk of surveillance?
	
 
__4) Switch your “human-being” with another group: go through the steps from 1) to 3) now considering the already modified body.__
