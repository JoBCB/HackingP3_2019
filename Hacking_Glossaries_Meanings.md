“In **biohacking**, the methods of computer hacking are transferred to biology.” pp. 245

“**Hack**: originally, an elegant solution for a technical problem was called a ‘hack’. Despite its short lifespan, the term is ambiguous. It appeared for the first time at the end of the 1950s in the context of the Tech Model Railroad (TMRC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); it is said that this club had great influence on the development of hacker jargon. In the pioneering days of computer history, the term was also used to describe little useful computer programs on mainframe computing systems that did word processing and calculated spreadsheets. Roughly spoken, a hacker is a person who has in-depth knowledge of a system and is not satisfied by simply taking on the role of a user. However, more and often than not, the objective is seek out systems’ weaknesses. Spectacular break-ins into mainframe computers and increasing internet criminality, which includes attacks on private computers, has given the term a negative connotation. The hacker scene, however, has distanced itself from such activities, also conceptually.” Source: Thomas, Douglas: Hacker Culture. Minnesota 2003 / Chaos Computer Club: Die Hacker-bibel. 2 volumes, Hamburg 1998 

“(hacking is a) community service with a non-profit purpose” - the way the federal tax authorities debated the concept when the first CCC was founded. Claus Pias, pp.153

“The virtual is the true domain of the **hacker**. It is from the virtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions of the actual. To the hacker, what is represented as being real is always partial, limited, perhaps even false. To the hacker there is always a surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible domain of what is real but not actual, what is not but which may become.” Wark, McKenzie: A hacker Manifesto. Cambridge, MA 2004, p.74

“In 1984, the American author Steven Levy described this fundamental idea more specifically in his book ‘Hackers’: demanding free access to technology and information is central, as is the conviction of being able to improve the world with it. The concept of sharing is also an important value of hacker ethics. Many ideas - for example, mistrusting authority for preferring decentralised forms of organisation - have their origins in 1970’s counterculture. The open source movement has taken over many impulses found in hacker ethics.” pp.250

“There are numerous variations of the hacker concept. For example, a **software hack** means that a computer program was changes by an intervention. It then does something other or more than it was intended to do. In a **hardware hack**, the intervention takes place at the level of the hardware (…)  The media - in this case newspapers, radio, TV, and the internet - are understood to be a system that functions according to very specific implicit rules. Breaking these rules and turning them agains the system is a **media hack**’s objective. A related artistic principle is a **reality hacking**. Here objects from daly life or in the public sphere are manipulated in such a way that a new assertion can be made.”

“**Cracker(s)** are those haters who perform illegal and profit oriented hacks.” // “A crack is a small program that metaphorically cracks and thus eliminates a protective shell. Programs that were manipulated is this way are called ‘Warez’. The term ‘crack’ also has other meanings that have nothing to do with its use in the computer scene. On the one had, a crack is a particularly gifted professional, on the other hand, it also refers to a chemical process with which paraffin is split, as well as a drug that was given its name because of the characteristics crackling sound that occurs when it is smoked.”

"Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that it cannot be re-engineered and transformed so as to widen our aperture of freedom, extending to gender and the human. To say that nothing is sacred, that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and to hack, is to say that nothing is supernatural."
