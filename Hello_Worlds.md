# < Hello Worlds > 

A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!".

## Introduction to the command line interface. 

__Shell__ = command line interpreter; a user interface for access to an operating system’s services. It can be graphical (GUI) or text based command line interface (CLI).

CLI shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))). 

__Command Line__ = the interface where users enter (type) and execute (press enter) commands.

A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))

__Terminal__ = text input/output environment or application.
