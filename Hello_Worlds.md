## Introduction to the command line interface. 

A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))

CLI shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))).
