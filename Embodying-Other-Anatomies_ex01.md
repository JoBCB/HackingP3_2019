	With your eyes closed, laying down on the floor; feel the surface below you. 
	Feel the weight/ lightness of you body; pressing the surrounding surfaces; The limits between surfaces.
	Keep the shoulders loose, relaxed, low and neck stretched; 
	Experience rotating towards the front of your body and towards the back of your body.
	Now feel your spinal vertebras quiet and aligned, erect and perpendicular from your coccyx;
	Soft knees, quiet spine.
	Feel any other tensions in the rest of your body, the stress on the ligaments of different joints from top to bottom — release them.

	Keep breathing.

	Breathing is the bridge between the voluntary and involuntary — the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system; the conscious and the unconscious; the inner and the outer.
	Activate the circulation.
	Inhalation (contract the abdomen) > Retention (3-5sec) > Exhalation (expand the abdomen);
	Breathing deeply helps circulation and oxygenation of the brain. Airstreams, generative circulation;
	The brain is irrigated by 2000 liners of blood everyday and this blood passes through many miles of capillaries.
	You are part of a vast circulatory network; which connects organs, functions, enactments.
	Imagine a map inside you consisting of arteries and veins. Travel through this pathways within your body;
	Like a mapping exercise. Feel the empty spaces; the in-betweens.

	Organ is the mother word for organ—ization.
	Continue breathing.


	Now go away from your body, levitate. 
	You are in a galaxy-like space — imagine its colours; maybe darkness - is there any light? What do you see?
	Suddenly you encountered a body — imagine its shape; texture; can you feel it? 
	Is it soft, hard or both? 
	Get closer, go inside it, and imagine yourself merging into this other body. 
	You are now one single body. 
	How does it feel to move like this new body? 
	Start moving slower, embody and experiment the new movements.
	How do different parts of this body are articulated and connected?
	What’s inside you that makes you move? What elements: bone structures, fluids, air? 
	How fast can you move? Does movement flow or break in staccato?

	Now be aware of your surroundings.
	And how does the body relate to this galaxy-like space?
	Take a moment to explore.

	Does your new body of yours make sound or any form of rhythm? 
	Where does this body hold memory? And where does it store its emotions and feelings?

	Remember a gesture from this experience. 

	We will leave this body and return to ours.

__Individually__

	Repeat the gesture: “it maintains the images abstracted by the imagination as infinitely repeatable, but this repeatability is accompanied by a change” 

	What is the gesture trying to say or do?
  
	Annotate the gesture — when doing so, find or create a language that best expresses the intention of this gesture.

__In groups__

	Share your 'gestures' and define the new ‘body’ emerging from this gestures.

	Understand how each gesture relies on a specific affordance (for eg.g.: waving relies on a body part that can be articulated in such a way); 
	How do this gestures shape the body? Write down the set of attributes / qualities/ characteristics that make the anatomy of this body.
