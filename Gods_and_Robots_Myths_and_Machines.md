**“These creatures that were made, not born”**

…


"The question of what it meant to be human obsessed the ancient Greeks. Time and again, their stories explore the promises and perils of staving off age and death, enhancing mortals’ capabilities, replicating nature. The complex network of myths about Prometheus, Jason and the Argonauts, Medea, Daedalus, Hephaestus, Talos, and Pandora—all raised basic questions about the boundaries between biological and manufactured beings. The most enduring, best- loved Greek myths—along with many other long-forgotten ancient tales—spin thrilling adventures well worth knowing for their own sake. But when we recognize the old stories as inquiries into **biotechne (bios, life; techne, craft)**, these “science actions” of antiquity take on new significance. 

…

The Greeks recognized that automata and other artifices in natural forms—whether imagined or actual— could be either harmless or dangerous, and they could be used for work, sex, spectacle, or religion, or to inflict pain or death. Clearly, biotechne, both real and imaginary, fascinated the ancients. Taken together, the myths, legends, and lore of past cultures about automata, robots, replicants, animated statues, extended human powers, self- moving machines, and other artificial beings, and the authentic technological wonders that followed, constitute a virtual library and museum of ancient wisdom and experiments in thinking, a priceless resource for understanding the fundamental challenges of biotechnology and synthetic life on the brink today.

We saw how the god Hephaestus made a fleet of “driverless” tripods that responded to commands to deliver food and wine. Even more remarkable was the covey of life-size golden female robots he devised to do his bidding. According to Homer, these divine servants were in every way “like real young women, with sense and reason, strength, even voices, and they were endowed with all the learning of immortals.” More than twenty- ve hundred years later, Arti cial Intelligence developers still aspire to achieve what the ancient Greeks imagined that their god of technological invention was capable of creating. Hephaestus’s marvels were envisioned by an ancient society not usually considered technologically advanced. Feats of biotechne were dreamed up by a culture that existed millennia before the advent of robots that win complex games, hold conversations, analyze massive mega-data, and infer human desires. But the big questions are as ancient as myth: Whose desires will AI robots reflect? 

…

But that unsettling oscillation between techno- nightmares and grand futuristic dreams—that is timeless. The ancient Greeks understood that the quintessential attribute of humankind is always to be tempted to reach **“beyond human”**, and to neglect to envision consequences. 

…

Biotechne stories, perpetuated over millennia, are a testament to the persistence of thinking and talking about what it is to be human and what it means to simulate life. 

…

The rise of a Robot– Artificial Intelligence “culture” no longer seems far-fetched. AI’s human inventors and mentors are already building the Robot-AI culture’s logos (logic), ethos (moral values), and pathos (emotions). As humans are enhanced by technology and become more like machines, robots are becoming infused with something like humanity. We are approaching what some call the new dawn of Robo-Humanity."
