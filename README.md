### Methology


# Rehearsing as Methodology

# Themes and Concepts to be explored:

- Staging (/interfacing): the notion of staging new scenarios beyond usership — spectatorship: explore different 'action play roles' in collaborative network settings with interdependent forms of agency. 

- Foster socio-political imagination (physical theatre); how to rethink participation and different conditions for affective interfacing of bodies and technologies?
