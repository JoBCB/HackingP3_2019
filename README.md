# Hacking Revisited

**“Hacks, whether analog, digital or analogical, always target the system.”** 


“…Manipulations, transformations, and unconventional redesigns of technical appliances which contain both analog or analog-electronic as well as digital components. (...) The brutality of a hack lies less in the tool itself than in the modus operandi and its purpose.” pp.198
