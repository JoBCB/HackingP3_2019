# Hacking 3 (minor) 2019 — WdKA, Rotterdam
Tutors: Ine Poppe and Joana Chicau (Practice); Mariana Aboim (Theory)
<!-- comment -->
jointly with Ceramic station & interventions with Sound & Image +  Interaction Station

This document gathers resources by _Joana Chicau_ { Rotterdam based graphic designer, coder, researcher — with a background in dance. Her trans-disciplinary project interweaves web programming languages and environments with choreographic practices. In her practice she researches theintersection of the body with the constructed, designed, programmed environment, aiming at in widening the ways in whichdigital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public. She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.

# Methodology

\ Rehearsing: as a way of enhancing the idea of process over product: processes of becoming; <br/>
/ Rehearsing: as a way to break the distancing between mind-body, self-other, subject-object, designer-design piece; discovery-invention. <br/>
\ Rehearsing: as a way of exploring new scenarios (beyond usership — spectatorship); <br/>
/ Rehearsing: as a way to embody different 'action play roles’ and inter-dependent forms of agency; <br/>
\ Rehearsing: as a way to rethink the construction of collective imaginaries and focus on collaboration; <br/>
/ Rehearsing: as a way to  to generate new modes of thinking composition matters, participation, relations and articulations between bodies and technologies; <br/>
\ Rehearsing: as a way to nurture practices of attention/ intention — how to render the body sensitive; 

**Objectives:**

\ Introduce the notion of Hacking and Bio-hacking; references and different artistic approaches to body and data politics; <br/>
/ Explore the notions of Hacking and Bio-hacking in connection to languages; gestures; protocols. <br/>
\ Understand the broader sociocultural implications of the latter; and historical perspectives. <br/>
/ Experience a holistic process in which embodiment and movement studies play a central role; <br/>
\ Critically address the different topics and methods — its usages and contexts.

## Inspecting Bodies

### From Organ to Organ-ization (Systems)

> Anatomy: deals with the structural organization of living things.  

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy)

> Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. 

> Physical ergonomics is concerned with human anatomy, and some of the anthropometric, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics as they relate to physical activity.

> "Marshall McLuhan took such ideas further. In his terminology, the extensions of man are all media. In "Understanding Media" he suggested that, "any invention of technology is an extension of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body" (1964, p.55).
The upshot is that,"by continuously embracing technologies, we relate to them as servomechanisms. That is why we must, to use them at all, serve these objects, these extensions of ourselves, as gods or minor religions" (p.56)."" [Source: Articial Organs](http://www.nous.org.uk/art.org.html)

> Computation and its imaginary are rich with contradictions, and loaded with metaphysical and ontological speculation. Underneath those contradictions and speculations lies an obsession with code that executes, the phantasm that words become flesh. It remains a phantasm, because again and again, the execution fails to match the boundless speculative expectations invested into it. Cultural and political semantics result merely from its dull formalisms and their interference with daily life, from account balance statements to “end-user software.” Formalisms create semantics in a wholly different way than people expect from an allegedly “intelligent machine.” Computers therefore exist, as hacker wisdom says, to solve problems which we would not even be aware of having if not for the computers themselves. — Florian Cramer

>The cultural history of computation shows that it is as rich and contradictory as that of any other symbolic form. It encompasses opposites, algorithms as a tool versus algorithms as a material of aesthetic play and speculation, computation as inner workings of nature (as in Pythagorean thought) or God (as in Kabbalah and magic) versus computation as culture and a medium of cultural reflection (starting with Oulipo and hacker cultures in the 1960s), computation as a means of abolishing semantics (Bense) versus computation as a means to structure and generate semantics (as in Lullism and Artificial Intelligence), computation as a means of generating totality (Quirinus Kuhlmann) versus computation as a means of taking things apart (Tzara, cut-ups), software as ontological freedom (GNU) versus software as ontological enslavement (Netochka Nezvanova), ecstatic computation (Kuhlmann, Kabbala, Burroughs) versus rationalist computation (from Leibniz to Turing) versus pataphysical computation as the parody of both rationalist and irrationalist computation (Oulipo and generative psychogeography), algorithm as expansion (Lullism, generative art) versus algorithm as constraint (Oulipo, net.art), code as chaotic imagination (Jodi, codeworks) versus code as structured description of chaos (Tzara, John Cage). — Florian Cramer

# Hacking Revisited

**“Hacks, whether analog, digital or analogical, always target the system.”** 


“…Manipulations, transformations, and unconventional redesigns of technical appliances which contain both analog or analog-electronic as well as digital components. (...) The brutality of a hack lies less in the tool itself than in the modus operandi and its purpose.” pp.198
