# Hacking 3 — WdKA, Rotterdam 2019
Tutors: Ine Poppe, Joy Mariama Smith and Joana Chicau (Practice); Mariana Aboim (Theory)
<!-- comment -->
jointly with Ceramic station & interventions with Sound & Image +  Interaction Station

This document gathers resources on the classes facilitated by [Joana Chicau](www.joanachicau.com ) — a Rotterdam based graphic designer, coder, researcher — with a background in dance. Her trans-disciplinary project interweaves web programming languages and environments with choreographic practices. In her practice she researches theintersection of the body with the constructed, designed, programmed environment, aiming at in widening the ways in whichdigital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public. She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.

# Introduction

### Theme and Objectives:

\ Explore the notions of Hacking in connection to bodies, technologies and automation; <br/>
/ Introduce the notion of Bio-hacking;  <br/>
\ Understand the underlying histories and broader sociocultural implications of the latter;  <br/>
/ Experience a holistic process in which embodiment and movement studies play a central role [see methology](###Methodology) <br/>
\  Critically address the different topics, methods and its different contexts. 


### Methology

\ Rehearsing: as a way of enhancing the idea of process over product: processes of becoming; <br/>
/ Rehearsing: as a way to break the distancing between mind-body, self-other, subject-object, designer-design piece; discovery-invention. <br/>
\ Rehearsing: as a way of exploring new scenarios (beyond usership — spectatorship); <br/>
/ Rehearsing: as a way to embody different 'action play roles’ and inter-dependent forms of agency; <br/>
\ Rehearsing: as a way to rethink the construction of collective imaginaries and focus on collaboration; <br/>
/ Rehearsing: as a way to  to generate new modes of thinking composition matters, participation, relations and articulations between bodies and technologies; <br/>
\ Rehearsing: as a way to nurture practices of attention/ intention — how to render the body sensitive.

> MakeHuman is '3D computer graphics middleware designed for the prototyping of photo realistic humanoids' and has gained visibility and popularity over time. It is actively developed by a collective of programmers, algorithms, modelers and academics and used by amateur animators to prototype modeling, by natural history museums for creating exhibition displays, by engineers to test multi-camera systems and by game-developers for sketching bespoke characters. Developers and users evidently work together to define and codify the conditions of presence for virtual bodies in MakeHuman. Since each of the agents in this collective somehow operates under the Modern regime of representation, we find the software full of assumptions about the naturality of perspective-based and linear representations, the essential properties of the species and so forth. Through its curious naming the project evokes the demiurg, dreaming of 'making' 'humans'to resemble his own image, the deviceful naming is a reminder of how the semiotic-material secrets of life's flows are strongly linked to the way software represents or allows bodies to be represented.

In "Understanding Media" he suggested that, "any invention of technology is an extension of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body" (1964, p.55).
The upshot is that,"by continuously embracing technologies, we relate to them as servomechanisms. That is why we must, to use them at all, serve these objects, these extensions of ourselves, as gods or minor religions" (p.56)."" [Source: Articial Organs](http://www.nous.org.uk/art.org.html)

## Gesture & Program

<img src="https://github.com/JoBCB/HackingP3_2019/blob/master/Gesture_Program.png" width="600">


> In computer science, a software agent is a computer program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency, which derives from the Latin **agere (to do)**: an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such "action on behalf of" implies the authority to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Agents are colloquially known as bots, from robot. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or as software such as a chatbot executing on a phone (e.g. Siri) or other computing device. Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Software agents interacting with people (e.g. chatbots, human-robot interaction environments) may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality or embody humanoid form. 

> Related and derived concepts include intelligent agents (in particular exhibiting some aspects of artificial intelligence, such as reasoning), autonomous agents (capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives), distributed agents (being executed on physically distinct computers), multi-agent systems (distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone), and mobile agents (agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors). [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent)


__[Before Siri and Alexa, there was ELIZA:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMK9AphfLco)__

> A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing Test (by Alan Turing / 1950, a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human).

> ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.
The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist (in particular, Carl Rogers, who was well-known for simply parroting back at patients what they'd just said) and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)

_Image:_ Tay was an artificial intelligence chatter bot that was originally released by Microsoft Corporation via Twitter (2016); [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot))

> "Material agency includes bodies and social structures but also technologies as in the case of computational nano/bio-technologies presenting new human machine assemblages and hybrid forms. Barad’s claim is that agency is emergent through the ‘inter-action’ of elements and signals different and distinct agencies acting together. In the case of the archive we need to account for social practices and human bodies, but also various nonhuman agents as part of this machinic assemblage. Our example is the way a program can only be understood as part of a distributive agency that includes the programmer, computer, network, factory worker, and wider scientific, military, economic, medical, political system within which data is materialised." [Data-body: human and nonhuman agency in the documents of Kurenniemi](http://activearchives.org/wiki/Archiving_the_Data-body:_human_and_nonhuman_agency_in_the_documents_of_Kurenniemi#Data_Bodies)

> Computation and its imaginary are rich with contradictions, and loaded with metaphysical and ontological speculation. Underneath those contradictions and speculations lies an obsession with code that executes, the phantasm that words become flesh. It remains a phantasm, because again and again, the execution fails to match the boundless speculative expectations invested into it. Cultural and political semantics result merely from its dull formalisms and their interference with daily life, from account balance statements to “end-user software.” Formalisms create semantics in a wholly different way than people expect from an allegedly “intelligent machine.” Computers therefore exist, as hacker wisdom says, to solve problems which we would not even be aware of having if not for the computers themselves. — Florian Cramer

>The cultural history of computation shows that it is as rich and contradictory as that of any other symbolic form. It encompasses opposites, algorithms as a tool versus algorithms as a material of aesthetic play and speculation, computation as inner workings of nature (as in Pythagorean thought) or God (as in Kabbalah and magic) versus computation as culture and a medium of cultural reflection (starting with Oulipo and hacker cultures in the 1960s), computation as a means of abolishing semantics (Bense) versus computation as a means to structure and generate semantics (as in Lullism and Artificial Intelligence), computation as a means of generating totality (Quirinus Kuhlmann) versus computation as a means of taking things apart (Tzara, cut-ups), software as ontological freedom (GNU) versus software as ontological enslavement (Netochka Nezvanova), ecstatic computation (Kuhlmann, Kabbala, Burroughs) versus rationalist computation (from Leibniz to Turing) versus pataphysical computation as the parody of both rationalist and irrationalist computation (Oulipo and generative psychogeography), algorithm as expansion (Lullism, generative art) versus algorithm as constraint (Oulipo, net.art), code as chaotic imagination (Jodi, codeworks) versus code as structured description of chaos (Tzara, John Cage). — Florian Cramer [Quote Source](http://cramer.pleintekst.nl/00-recent/words_made_flesh/html/words_made_fleshch2.html#x5-40002)

# Hacking Revisited

**“Hacks, whether analog, digital or analogical, always target the system.** 


…Manipulations, transformations, and unconventional redesigns of technical appliances which contain both analog or analog-electronic as well as digital components. (...) The brutality of a hack lies less in the tool itself than in the modus operandi and its purpose.” Verena Kuni essay: Analogital Hacks — Source: _Dominik Landwehr (Hg.): Hacking; Edition Digital Culture 2; Migros-Kulturprozent, Christoph Merian Verlag; Oktober 2014, Deutsch/Englisch, ISBN_
