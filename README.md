# Hacking 3 (minor) 2019 — WdKA, Rotterdam
Tutors: Ine Poppe and Joana Chicau (Practice); Mariana Aboim (Theory)

jointly with Ceramic station & interventions with Sound & Image +  Interaction Station

This document gathers resources by _Joana Chicau_ { Rotterdam based graphic designer, coder, researcher — with a background in dance. Her trans-disciplinary project interweaves web programming languages and environments with choreographic practices. In her practice she researches theintersection of the body with the constructed, designed, programmed environment, aiming at in widening the ways in whichdigital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public. She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.

> "Marshall McLuhan took such ideas further. In his terminology, the extensions of man are all media. In "Understanding Media" he suggested that, "any invention of technology is an extension of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body" (1964, p.55).
The upshot is that,"by continuously embracing technologies, we relate to them as servomechanisms. That is why we must, to use them at all, serve these objects, these extensions of ourselves, as gods or minor religions" (p.56)."" [Source: Articial Organs](http://www.nous.org.uk/art.org.html)

# Hacking Revisited

**“Hacks, whether analog, digital or analogical, always target the system.”** 


“…Manipulations, transformations, and unconventional redesigns of technical appliances which contain both analog or analog-electronic as well as digital components. (...) The brutality of a hack lies less in the tool itself than in the modus operandi and its purpose.” pp.198
